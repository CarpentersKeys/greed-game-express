todo!

    app.js 
        figure out how to loop round stages in patientReducer without rechallenging
        just chain two patientReducers?

    util
        should I make a deep promise.all that can rebuild the object? or just stick with recursion for depth?

    valiudation fn:
        refactor role validation
    
    gamefunction: 
        game result reducde
        startstage

    test:
        patientReduce, does it properly handle thenables in the return of the acc or on the arr

    ui
        prepare fs for ui clients (rename app.js to game.js?)
        setup appjs for discord
        build slash commands
            challenge
            quit game
        build messages
        build event listeners

questions: 
    FP allow global constants? 
        NO
    how to handle exceptions with FP
    do I need to pass UI functions into async handlers to maintain promiseFirst pattern
    at what point do I want to filter the player objects and what do I need from them?
    can I reset the index of a reducer?

async needs:
    issue challenge
    accept challenge
    waiting for selectTime
    waiting for race

game flow
    -issue challenge (some setup can begin)
    -async accept challenge
    -finish setup
    -asynch selectTime
    -async race
    -get results


patterns used:
    for functions that require UI and async interactions: promiseFirst
        intialize promise/event handlers that await the interactions
        send UI messages or whatever
    function params:
        receive a functionNameResult object desctructure in the params
        if the full object is needed to be passed into a subfn use arguments[0]

refactor ideas:
    get all stages as an array of function
    call playRound recursively on a patientReducer implementation 

theme:
    prisoners dilemma
       at the end both players can choose if they want to play again, if they both choose to play again another round is started, if one choses to and the other doesn't, that player sthsthsth

client responsibilities:
    send UI and messages
    receieve responses
        players list, which players is the challenger
    emit events with response info

server (it's all server baby) responsibilities:
    recieve client events
    game logic

    /**questions:
 * when do I want to resolve promises?
 *      if I resolve at the beginning, I won't have time to run my cb logic
 *      resovle at the end means promises on the incoming arr would have to be resolved in the callback somehow 
 * is there a way to replace promises with their resolved values when it happens? custom promise.all?
 */

/**
 *  in my special case I need to pass functions that will result in objects that contain promises
 *  the functions are invoked inside the cb, their resulting objects will be referenced on the accumulator
